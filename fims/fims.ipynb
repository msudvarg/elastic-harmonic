We make calls to `getrusage()` when each job completes, measuring the total CPU time (user and system) consumed by the task since the end of the prior job. This accounts for execution of the task's function plus the overhead of context switching and timer handling. To capture worst-case conditional behavior, we force recalculation of the inversion matrix with each iteration of data inversion.\n",
